Question 1: What is the advantage of using Vertex Arrays above immediate 
mode rendering?

Question 2: What are uvec and vvec in the Surfel structure? What properties of 
the splat do they represent?

Question 3: On the slide, it is not shown how to compute peye. This
is the position in of the point in eye (view)-space. What matrix should be
used to transform a position from object-space to eye-space?

Question 4: Does it matter whether we pass the surfel color to the
vertex shader in a texture coordinate (glTexCoord...) or as the vertex color
(glColor...)? Why (not)?

Question 5: What matrix should you use to transform the u and v vectors? Is
it different from the matrix you would use to transform a normal? Why (not)?

Question 6: Why would we want to move as much computations as
possible from the fragment program to the vertex program, or even from the
vertex program to the application?

Question 7: Does it matter which values the outputs have when a
fragment is discarded?

Question 8: What is the difference between a texture and a render buffer?

Question 9: Why must depth write be disabled when blending the fragments?
