1. What attributes do we absolutely need for diffuse and specular per-pixel
Phong shading, in addition to the accumulated Gaussian kernel weight (1
float)?
The (interpolated) normal.
Material color.

2. Instead of doing backface culling we can also set the \texttt{epsilon}
parameter to a very small value to ignore the back-facing layers. Why is
this not a good solution?

3. Instead of storing explicit normals as attribute, the normal 
could also be calculated  from the depth attribute by taking 
directional derivatives. Name one advantage and a disadvantage of doing this.
