1. What attributes do we absolutely need for diffuse and specular per-pixel
Phong shading, in addition to the accumulated Gaussian kernel weight (1
float)?
The (interpolated) normal.
Material color.

2. Instead of doing backface culling we can also set the \texttt{epsilon}
parameter to a very small value to ignore the back-facing layers. Why is
this not a good solution?
Depth buffering is slower than Backface culling, since every pixel has to be checked.
When using backface culling, only vertices are checked.

3. Instead of storing explicit normals as attribute, the normal 
could also be calculated  from the depth attribute by taking 
directional derivatives. Name one advantage and a disadvantage of doing this.
