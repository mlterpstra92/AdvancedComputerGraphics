Question 1: In which case, magnification or minification, will the
screen-space filter make the splat bigger?

Question 2: Will it ever make the splat smaller?

Question 3: A vertex shader always outputs the homogeneous vertex
coordinates in clip-space in the \texttt{POSITION} binding semantic. Which
two steps are needed to get to the window coordinates from there?

Question 4: Why is taking the minimum of the two squared distances
before applying the Gaussian equivalent to taking the maximum of the
resulting kernel function values? (Given that the standard deviation is the
same in both cases)

Question 5: For very large sizes of the screen-space filter,
around 22, black areas start to appear around splats that are most
perpendicular to the viewing plane. The same happens if we try to
anti-alias, for example, the lion. This is due to the depth extrapolation,
which becomes invalid outside of the object-space splats, and thus starts to
obscure things that should not be when the screen-space filter makes the
splats bigger. How could this be resolved?
