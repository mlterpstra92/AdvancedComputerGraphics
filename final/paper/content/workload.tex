\section{Workload division}
All the programming was done in pairs so we'd value that the programming was 50-50 effort.

For the report, Bram focused more on problem definition, and implementation while Maarten focused more on the solution as proposed by the paper and the introduction.

All in all, we feel that we both contributed equally to the entire final project.
